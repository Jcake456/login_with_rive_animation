## 📌 Description

🚀 This project showcases a modern login screen built with **Flutter**, integrated with **Rive** animations powered by a **State Machine**.  

The animated bear reacts dynamically to user interactions, creating a playful yet functional authentication experience.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how real-time animations can improve user experience through interaction-driven design.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔒 Password visibility toggle  
- 👀 Animated reactions to user actions (typing, checking, success, error)  
- 🎯 Interactive State Machine logic  
- 💡 Clean UI built with Flutter’s Material components  
- ⏳ Responsive behavior using timers and animation triggers

## 🎨 What is Rive?

Rive is a real-time interactive animation tool and runtime that allows developers and designers to create lightweight, high-performance vector animations for web, mobile, and game applications.  

Unlike traditional animations (such as GIFs or pre-rendered videos), Rive animations are **dynamic and state-driven**. This means they can respond to user interactions, application logic, and real-time data.  

Because animations are rendered programmatically, they are optimized for performance and ideal for modern, interactive user interfaces.

### Common Use Cases:
- ✨ Interactive UI elements  
- 🎮 Game animations  
- 📱 Mobile app micro-interactions  
- 🌐 Web-based animations

## 🔄 What is a State Machine in Rive?

A **State Machine** in Rive controls how and when animations transition between different states. Instead of playing a single linear animation, it allows you to define multiple states such as:

- `idle`
- `hover`
- `pressed`
- `success`
- `error`

Transitions between these states are triggered using:

- ✅ Boolean inputs  
- 🔢 Numeric inputs  
- 🚀 Trigger inputs  

This enables animations to react automatically to user interactions or application events.

For example, in this project:
- The bear looks at the text field while typing 👀  
- Covers its eyes when entering a password 🙈  
- Reacts differently on success or error ✅❌  

In short, **State Machines make Rive animations interactive, responsive, and deeply integrated with application logic.**

🛠️ __Technologies Used__

🧩 Flutter — UI framework

🎬 Rive — animation integration

🧠 StateMachineController — for handling animation logic

💻 Dart — programming language
